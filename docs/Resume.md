## üôã About
I am a data science student currently pursuing my **Master's at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC)**, with a strong foundation in **Electrical & Electronics Engineering**. My hands-on experience at **Capgemini** allowed me to design and fine-tune **deep learning models‚Äîincluding ANN and CNN architectures‚Äîfor medical imaging and diagnostic prediction**, as well as build advanced **NLP pipelines** for clinical data analysis.  

My technical expertise spans diverse tools and methodologies, from **Python and MATLAB/Simulink to SQL and Tableau**. I have implemented data-driven solutions that improved billing accuracy and streamlined operational processes, in addition to contributing to research projects involving control systems and fuzzy logic‚Äîskills developed through my work on **BLDC motor drive simulations**.  

These experiences have cultivated my **analytical mindset** and strengthened my ability to tackle complex engineering and data-related challenges. Passionate about leveraging **data-driven insights** to create tangible real-world impact, I thrive in **collaborative, multidisciplinary environments** that bridge research and practical applications.
